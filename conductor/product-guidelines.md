# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity (Glassmorphism)
- **Glass Effect:** All main containers and cards must use frosted glass effects (`backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`) with semi-transparent backgrounds to create depth and sophistication.
- **Backgrounds:** Utilize high-quality dark-themed backgrounds with subtle mesh gradients or geometric patterns to make the transparency of the glass layers pop.
- **Accents:** Employ a sophisticated dark mode-first approach with dark gray transparency layers and subtle neon accent colors (like cyan or lime) for primary actions and status indicators.
- **Depth & Borders:** Apply thin, high-contrast white borders and soft, deep shadows to cards to give them a modern "floating" effect.

## UI/UX Design
- **Modular Layout:** Organize the interface into a clean grid of discrete glass modules for the timer, weekly summary, and activity logs to maintain organization.
- **Action Emphasis:** Highlight primary controls like "Start Timer" with high-contrast accent colors and larger typography to ensure they are the clear focus.
- **Minimalist Visualization:** Integrate clean, subtle charts and progress bars that blend naturally with the glass layers for a minimalist feel.

## Prose & Communication
- **Professional & Technical Tone:** Communication should be concise, professional, and technically precise. Focus on efficiency and accuracy, especially regarding time calculations and data management.
- **Direct Messaging:** Avoid unnecessary fluff; respect the user's time by using direct language that facilitates quick task completion.

## Interaction Design
- **High-Impact Motion:** Use orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals and smooth transitions to create a polished, professional atmosphere.
- **Micro-interactions:** Implement subtle animations for buttons and state changes to provide elegant feedback while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic.
